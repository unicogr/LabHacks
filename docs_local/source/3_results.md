Cortical BOLD response.** *Left*: [Drifting bar aperture used in population receptive field mapping](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14MRGpbjya8KwtLup8kAvR8EmKF5svNSr/view?usp=sharing). *Right*: [Cortical BOLD responses to the drifting bar stimuli depicted on a flattened cortical reconstruction for a single hemisphere](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17JkrsSYfcZkWn2gZsGGb1wURvY_gLqTL/view?usp=sharing) (using Freesurfer's *fsaverage*). Black traces indicate the borders between visual cortical maps V1, V2 and V3 within 0.1 and 6 degrees of visual eccentricity. Within each of these maps, nearby neurons respond to nearby locations in the visual image, with this property (receptive fields) extending along cortical hierarchy. Neuronal responses across cortical sites were approximated using a mean field approximation of retino-cortical inputs, resulting on stimuli-dependent estimates for the neuronal drive in V1, V2 and V3. These estimates are then translated to BOLD activity using an empirically established spatiotemporal hemodynamic response function (st-HRF).|
